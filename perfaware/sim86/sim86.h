/* NOTE(casey): _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS is here because otherwise we cannot
   call fopen(). If we replace fopen() with fopen_s() to avoid the warning,
   then the code doesn't compile on Linux anymore, since fopen_s() does not
   exist there.
   
   What exactly the CRT maintainers were thinking when they made this choice,
   I have no idea.
